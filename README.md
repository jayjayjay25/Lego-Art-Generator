# Lego-Art-Generator

This mini project was inspired by Lego's Marilyn Monroe, a build of a portrait of one of the frames from Andy Warhol's Marilyn Diptych, which uses colored plates in order to construct the potrait. The goal of this project is to take any image and generate a new image using only 1x1 round plates in available colors that Lego has to offer. The file lego_art_gen_kmeans.py takes any image, clusters the image's pixels using kmeans into k pre-specified clusters, then computes the closest "Lego" color to each of those clusters' averages. Thus, the final output is an image where each pixel in the image is replaced with the most appropriate color from the 164 available colors (according to bricklink.com, see scrape.py and bricklink_colors.csv) that 1x1 round Lego plates can take on. A dataframe specifying, for each color in the image, the quantity of each Lego plate required to complete the build is also outputted.
