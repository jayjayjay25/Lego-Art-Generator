# Lego-Art-Generator

This mini project was inspired by Lego's Marilyn Monroe, a build of a portrait of one of the frames from Andy Warhol's Marilyn Diptych, which uses colored plates in order to construct the potrait. The goal of this project is to take any image and generate a new image using only 1x1 round plates in available colors that Lego has to offer. The file lego_art_gen_kmeans.py takes any image, clusters the image's pixels using kmeans into k (heuristically chosen ahead of time, most paintings have around 15-25 colors) clusters, then computes the closest "Lego" color to each of those clusters' averages and assigns to each pixel in a cluster that Lego color. Thus, the final output is an image where each pixel in the image is replaced with the most appropriate color from the 164 available colors (according to bricklink.com, see scrape.py and bricklink_colors.csv) that 1x1 round Lego plates can take on. A dataframe specifying, for each color in the image, the quantity of each Lego plate required to complete the build is also outputted. This tends to work well on images with around 5-10 prominent colors in various shades and the quality of the output does heavily depend on how well it looks after the image is first compressed to specified dimensions. The Marilyn Monroe is around 4 square feet in area but only 53 by 53 studs, so keep that in mind when you settle on a picture and what dimensions yield the best quality per stud/square foot.
